## Usage of Data

Ayumi may use stored data, as defined below, to offer different features and services. No usage of data outside of the aforementioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any third-party site or service.

### Databases

Ayumi uses databases to store information about users, in order to provide its features and services.

#### The databases may store

 - `user_id` of users (the unique id of a Discord account),
 - `timestamps` of actions (for example when a command has been used),
 - `guild_id` of guilds the bot is member of (the unique id of a Discord guild),
 - `channel_id` of channels belonging to guilds the bot is member of (the unique id of a Discord channel),
 - `message_id` of messages send by users in guilds the bot is member of (the unique id of a Discord message),
and any combination of those.

For example, Ayumi may associate your `user_id` with a `message_id` and a `timestamp` for any message that you send in a channel belonging to guilds the bot is member of.

Ayumi may further store data that you explicitly provided for Ayumi to offer its services. For example the reason of a moderative action when using its moderation commands.

Furthermore, upon utilization of our help service, user_ids and channel_ids are stored to track when/how many questions a user asks. The data may be stored for up to **30** days.

The stored data is not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

No other personal information outside of the above mentioned one will be stored. In particular,  Ayumi does not store the content of sent messages.

All information stored in the databases about you will be permanently deleted from our databases by removing the bot from the server.

## Logging

Ayumi follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log users when they use one of the bot's provided commands, features or services. Ayumi does not store any data reflected on the console and can only use it for instant error tracking.

### The information collected by logs include

 - `global_name` of users (the unique name of a Discord account),
 - `user_id` of users (the unique id of a Discord account),
 - `timestamps` of actions (for example when a command has been used),
 - `guild_id` of guilds the bot is member of (the unique id of a Discord guild),
 - `channel_id` of channels belonging to guilds the bot is member of (the unique id of a Discord channel),
 - `message_id` of messages send by users in guilds the bot is member of (the unique id of a Discord message).
The stored data is not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

No other personal information outside of the above mentioned one will be stored. In particular, Ayumi does not store the content of sent messages.

The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the bot, and gathering demographic information.

Temporarely stored Information

Ayumi may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time. After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.
    
Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from a Server.

## Removal of Data

Removal of the data can be requested through e-mail at [cartelizm@icloud.com](mailto:cartelizm@icloud.com).

For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the Server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the Server, if still present on it.

## Third Party Privacy Policies

This Privacy Policy does not apply to other linked websites or service providers. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party websites or services for more detailed information. It may include their practices and instructions about how to opt-out of certain options.

## Children's Information

Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.

Ayumi does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information to our bot, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

## Limitations

Our Privacy Policy applies only to Ayumi instances that are member of a Server owned by Klaus Development.

This policy is not applicable to any information collected by bot instances hosted by other parties, even if they have been build based on our official source. This policy is also not applicable to any information collected via channels other than this bot, such as the data collected by linked websites.
